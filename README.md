## About Application

This application is part of a test, where an analysis of legislative data must be conducted, and files with the results should be generated.

### Questions

- Discuss your solution’s time complexity. What tradeoffs did you make?
- How would you change your solution to account for future columns that might be requested, such as “Bill Voted On Date” or “Co-Sponsors”?
- How would you change your solution if instead of receiving CSVs of data, you were given a list of legislators or bills that you should generate a CSV for?
- How long did you spend working on the assignment?
